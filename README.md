# SumoBot-2014-2015
## McMaster SumoBot Competition
## Group EH! - McMaster SumoBots 2nd Year - BoHan Zhang, Braden Corbold, Colin Gillespie

All code written by Bohan, Braden, and Colin with the help of the SumoBots mentors and Execs.
Object of the Sumobots competition is to build an autonomous robot that pushes the opponent out 
of a circle ring. The robot must fit in a 10cm by 10cm size constant (no height limit) and
must weigh less than 500g. In our design we have two motors to power our robot, as well as
two QRD sensors to detect the edge of the ring (painted white, inside painted black) and 
two sonar sensors used to locate the opponent.
